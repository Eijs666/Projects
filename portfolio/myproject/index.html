          I am an experienced developer with a solid background in a wide range

          business application context. My expertise
          includes all stages of development, from initial analysis to

          requirements for applications</p>

        <p>
          I have managed to replace my father's old and expensive
          monitoring system, with a cheaper and better and DIY
          solution using a Raspberry PI and MotionEyeOS.
          Here I have made a monitoring system with a Raspberry
          PI and a webcam.
