        <p>
          I am an experienced developer with a solid 
          background in a wide range of technical aspects including 
          .NET development, JavaScript, C#, and Java and I know how to
           apply these technologies in a business context. My expertise 
           includes all stages of development, from initial analysis to 
           design and execution. I am skilled in a variety of different 
           platforms and systems. In addition to my technical skills, I 
           am a good communicator and team player. My ability to 
           communicate well allows me to work effectively with customers 
           to identify goals and requirements for applications.

        <p>
          In recent years, I have experimented with

          and developed various websites and 
          web applications.

        <p>
          I have managed to replace my father's old and expensive
          monitoring system, with a cheaper and better and DIY
          solution using a Raspberry PI and MotionEyeOS.
          Here I have made a monitoring system with a Raspberry
          PI and a webcam.
